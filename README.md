# onedark-afterglow.vim

A dark Vim color scheme for the GUI and 16/256-color terminals, based on [Afterglow](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme), with colors inspired by the excellent [One Dark syntax theme](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io).

This is forked from joshdick's onedark.vim, you'll find a fully detailed README about installing and working with this theme there. And STAR it !
